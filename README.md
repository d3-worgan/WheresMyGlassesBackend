# Wheres My Glasses (Backend)
This is one of three parts of a final year digital systems project from the University of the West of England. The complete
system was used to implement a voice activated object location assistant for people with dementia. This part of the system
maintains the status of objects and their locations in the room using the Darknet neural network and the YOLO object detection
algorithm. The system waits for MQTT requests (generated by the frontend voice assistant) which specify objects to 
search for. Whilst waiting the system maintains state by taking regular snapshots of the room. When the MQTT request is 
recieved, it then generates location information depending on the outcome of the search of the room and its memory. The 
associated [frontend voice assistant](https://github.com/d3-worgan/WheresMyGlassesFrontend) code can be used to trigger 
the requests and handle the output messages. There is also [associated code](https://github.com/d3-worgan/darknet-docker) 
for data acquisition and training object detection models using docker containers.

## Installation
The current implementation has been written and tested for Linux only.
##### 1. Install the RealSense SDK
1. Install the [RealSense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) by downloading the installer in the 
latest [release](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases); make sure the python developer package is 
ticked during in the installation.
2. After installation copy realsense2.pyd and realsense2.dll from the bin directory of the installation 
(e.g. “```C:\Program Files\IntelrealsenseSDK 2.0\bin```”) into either the python or anaconda site-packages folder installed on 
the machine (e.g. “```C:\Anaconda\Lib\site-packages```”).
##### 2. Build and install Darknet & YOLO
To use yolo and darknet we need the darknet library / binary file (```.so``` file on linux). The python bindings to the 
library are managed in ```modules/darknet.py```. The easiest way to build the binaries is using the ```make``` command 
which is explained in the [AlexyAB repo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-compile-on-linux-using-make). 
Once the ```.so``` file has been built copy it into the ```modules/``` directory.
##### 3. Download and install detection models

##### 3. Setup a conda environment and python dependencies
